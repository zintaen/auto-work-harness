"""planner -> parallel workers (isolated worktrees) -> verifier -> serialized merge.

The only multi-agent shape with strong *coding* evidence (Augment Intent;
Anthropic orchestrator-worker). The invariants this module enforces:

  * Workers run in PARALLEL but each in its OWN git worktree — isolated writes,
    no shared context to fragment (Cognition's objection is about shared-context
    writes; hard filesystem isolation sidesteps it).
  * A SEPARATE verifier reviews each worker's artifact against the spec before
    anything merges ("never validate your own code in the same context window").
  * Merges are SERIALIZED through the integration branch by the orchestrator —
    never agent-to-agent — so a conflict is caught and aborted, not propagated.
  * Cross-worker handoff is via filesystem artifacts + lightweight references, not
    a game-of-telephone of full traces.

Workers and the verifier are injected callables, so the orchestration is unit
tested with stubs against a real temporary repository (and, in one test, the real
Stage-2 Verifier).
